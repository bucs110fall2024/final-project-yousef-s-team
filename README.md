I plan on creating a game where a person runs in the right direction endlessly until they hit an obstacle, and then the game ends.
GUI Design: I think I will have a play button in the middle of the screen for the GUI, and then a try again button once the game is over.
-Will have a start menu
-Will have a character that moves in response to inputs
-Will have obstacle collisions
-Will have a dynamic background
-Will have a game over screen
